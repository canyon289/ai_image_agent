    "\n",
    "[Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) is a family of open-weight models from Google DeepMind, designed for efficiency and strong reasoning capabilities.  \n",
    "- **2B parameters**: Small enough to run locally but powerful enough for real tasks.  \n",
    "- **Supports in-context learning**: Like other transformer models, Gemma can classify and generate outputs based on provided examples without additional training.  \n",
    "- **Works well for zero-shot classification**: Like other modern LLMs, Gemma can classify inputs based on prompts without fine-tuning.  \n",
    "- **Fast and cost-effective**: Unlike larger models, Gemma 2B runs efficiently on consumer hardware.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Ollama: A Game Changer for Local LLMs  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](img/ollama.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) makes running **LLMs locally** seamless, without complex setup.  \n",
    "- **Pre-configured model execution**: No need to manually set up dependencies.  \n",
    "- **Efficient GPU/CPU inference**: Optimized for running on local machines.  \n",
    "- **Fast iteration loop**: Load a model once, then run queries without excessive overhead.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By combining **Gemma 2B** with **Ollama**, we get a **lightweight, fast, and cost-free AI system** that can perform real-world classification tasks directly on our machines.  "
